Here's a list of some of the projects I've been involved in over the years:

<!-- FIXME: More from HIQ? -->

* [Predicting Discharge Barriers to Optimize Patient Flow](https://www.hospiq.com/blog/prioritizing-and-processing-discharges-to-better-manage-patient-flow/).

* Predicting which [Operating Room reservation blocks](https://www.hospiq.com/solutions/perioperative/)
  are most likely to go unused.

* The [OM1 Medical Burden Index (OMBIÂ®)](https://www.om1.com/solutions/aipredictivemedicine/ombi/)
  that measures the combined medical burden of an individual or a patient population.
  It is a 1-1000 score of patient level comorbidity
  that is highly predictive of future resource utilization and mortality.
