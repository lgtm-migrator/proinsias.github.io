Due to the vast number of medical billing codes, it is generally infeasible to
generate machine learning features from them as one-hot vectors.
[This paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00516) discusses the use of
[Canonical Correlation Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_correlation)
to reduce this dimensionality and capture the inherent relationships that exist
between the codes.
