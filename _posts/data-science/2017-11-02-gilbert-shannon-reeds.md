> In the mathematics of shuffling playing cards, the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model is a probability distribution on riffle
  shuffle permutations that has been reported to be a good match for experimentally observed outcomes of human
  shuffling, and that forms the basis for a recommendation that a deck of cards should be riffled seven times in order
  to thoroughly randomize it.
> The deck of cards is cut into two packets... [t]hen, one card at a time is repeatedly moved from the bottom of one of
  the packets to the top of the shuffled deck.

Here we implement the Gilbert–Shannon–Reeds model, and verify this recommendation of seven shuffles.

First, define a function to determine how many cards to split into our right hand.
